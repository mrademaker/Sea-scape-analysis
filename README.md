# Sea-scape-analysis

This repository contains the data and code used to analyse the spatial-temporal patterns of fish populations in the North-and Dutch Wadden Sea area based on long-term systematic survey data (1977-2019).
The repository consists of three sub-projects:

- [Data](Data) - contains the raw and filtered catch per unit effort per length class (cpue_length_per_hour) extracted from the public ICES-DATRAS database.
  (https://datras.ices.dk/Data_products/Download/Download_Data_public.aspx), as well as the Geospatial data used in defining the Seascapes.
- [Script](Script) - here you can find the code used to go from the raw to the filtered dataset as well, as the subsequent modelling performed on the filtered dataset.
- [Seascapes](Seascapes) - the results of the analysis per species
